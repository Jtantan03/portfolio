          "I am a career shifter from the aviation industry, and I made the
          decision to shift my career path after seeing the potential of
          programming and web development. I believe that pursuing a career in
          coding or web design will allow me to explore my passion for
          technology and innovation. As a result, I enrolled in the StackTrek
          Bootcamp course to develop my coding and web design skills, and I am
          proud to say that I have completed the course and created a capstone
          project called Mindscapes, a diary-type website."

            safely. My responsibilities included monitoring flight tracks,
            weather forecasts, radio communication, and assisting in creating
            flight plans.

            coordinate procedures and operations from the start of the flight
            until its completion.
